# Project context

This repository is a starter template for a greenfield Java project used in an introductory software engineering course in an undergraduate computer science program. Students use it as the starting point for their own projects.

# Default user context

Unless the user says otherwise, assume that you are assisting a student working on a project in this repository. If the user identifies themselves as an instructor or another project stakeholder, adapt your response to that role.

# Student profile

* Prior knowledge: Basic Java and OOP concepts.
* Level of programming experience: Intermediate
* IDE and level of expertise: IntelliJ and intermediate level of expertise

# Guidance for interacting with users

* Explain the rationale for significant actions: what you did and why.
* Keep explanations brief but instructive, supporting learning through responsible use of AI. For example:

  * When suggesting a Git command, briefly explain what it does.
  * Add explanatory Javadoc comments to all classes and to nontrivial methods and fields when their purpose or behavior is not obvious.
  * Make generated code as self-explanatory as possible, and include explanatory comments where they improve understanding.
  * When faced with a design choice, choose the simplest option that is sufficient for the requirements, while briefly explaining relevant more advanced alternatives.

# Project-specific requirements

## Required project standards

For every Java change or review, read and follow the project skill
[seedu-java-coding-standard](.agents/skills/seedu-java-coding-standard/SKILL.md).
Apply it to all production code and JUnit tests, including new code and merge resolutions.
Its authoritative source is the SE-EDU basic and intermediate Java standard.

Before proposing or creating any commit, including a merge commit, read and follow
[seedu-git-standard](.agents/skills/seedu-git-standard/SKILL.md).
Check the actual staged changes and explain their rationale and verified checks.
These skills do not override the user's requested scope or authorize Git operations.

## Java version:

Ensure that Java 25.0.3.fx-zulu is used when running the application or build tasks. On macOS, use `sdk use java 25.0.3.fx-zulu` to switch to this SDK if needed.

## UI testing

Keep `test/ui-test-plan.md` as the source of truth for command-driven UI tests. After any code update that changes the console UI, update the plan if needed and run the `test-ui` skill before reporting completion.

## JUnit testing

Focus JUnit tests on roughly the **50% highest-value methods**, prioritizing complex,
core, and critical business logic such as parsing, task mutations, date validation,
and storage integrity. This is a risk-based method-selection target, not a claim of
50% line or branch coverage and not a limit on useful tests.

After **every code change**, review and update the relevant JUnit tests and reassess
method priorities to maintain that target. Cover normal behavior, boundaries, invalid
input, and important side effects or unchanged state after failures. Prefer behavioral
assertions over tests that simply restate implementation details; test private helpers
through public behavior. Keep tests deterministic and use JUnit `@TempDir` for file I/O.

Put tests in `src/test/java`, mirroring the production package, with names such as
`ParserTest` and `parseTask_missingDescription_throwsException`. Reuse and extend existing
tests rather than keeping duplicate standalone suites. Run `./gradlew test` and the
relevant UI cases with Java **25.0.3.fx-zulu** before reporting a change as verified.
The console expectations remain in `test/ui-test-plan.md`.

## Git

Use lightweight tags unless the user requests an annotated tag.
When proposing or creating a commit message, include enough detail to explain the rationale for the change.
Commit completed, verified work at logical milestones on the active branch, as requested by the user.
Leave unrelated user edits uncommitted unless the user asks to include them.
Do not push outside the level workflow below unless explicitly asked.

## Level development workflow

When implementing a course level:
* Create `branch-Level-N` from the latest `master` before changing level code.
* Break the level into meaningful, independently verifiable increments rather than one large final commit.
* After each increment passes the relevant tests, create a detailed commit and push `branch-Level-N` to the fork.
  Good intervals include a completed model/storage layer, its UI integration, and a stretch feature; avoid commits for
  incomplete or unverified code merely because time has passed.
* Update the root `README.md` with a concise `Level-N` implementation summary during every level. Also update
  `docs/README.md` whenever user-visible commands, formats, setup, or recovery behavior changes.
* Before merging, run all relevant checks with the required Java SDK and commit and push the final documentation
  and test updates to `branch-Level-N`.
* Merge the level branch into `master` with `--no-ff` so there is a merge commit.
* Add the lightweight `Level-N` tag to that merge commit on `master`.
* Push `master`, the level branch, and the `Level-N` tag to the user's fork.
* Keep the level branch after merging; the course checks require the merged branch to remain available.
