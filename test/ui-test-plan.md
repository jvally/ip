# UI Test Plan

This file is the source of truth for command-driven UI regression tests.
Update it whenever the console UI changes.

Program command: `python3 test/run-ui-session.py`

Run the test-ui skill with Java 25.0.3.fx-zulu selected using `sdk use java 25.0.3.fx-zulu`.
The session helper compiles and runs each case in its own temporary directory, so tests never
read or overwrite real task data. The original cases also test startup without a data folder.
The following test-only directives in Inputs are consumed by the helper, not sent to Friday:

- `@restart` ends the current input stream (EOF) and starts Friday again with the same data folder.
- `@file RECORD` supplies a line of the initial save file before startup.
- `@directory` creates a directory instead of the save file, to test a read failure.
- `@block-save` blocks the destination with a nonempty directory after startup, to test a write failure.

Both runners discover Java sources in nested package folders under `src/main/java`.
Java test classes mirror their package directories under `test`, which remains the test source root.

The helper does not supply expected output; all console expectations remain in this plan.

Parser, task-list, storage, and date/time checks (including command syntax, task numbering, invalid records, and failed writes)
can also be run with the same JDK from the project root:

```bash
python3 test/run-unit-tests.py
```

Both test runners use Python's platform-specific temporary directory and require `java` and `javac` on `PATH`.
On Windows, use `python` or `py -3` if your Python installation does not provide `python3`.

- Inputs:

@file T|1|finished task
@file T|0|pending task
@block-save
mark 1
unmark 2
mark 2
unmark 1

## Test Case: Task-number syntax and range errors
- Aim: Verify malformed numbers retain command-specific errors, out-of-range numbers do not change tasks, valid integer spellings still work, and input errors do not end the session.
- Inputs:

mark nope
mark -1
unmark 0
delete 2147483648
delete -2
mark +1
unmark 01
